The war was ended when an experimental antimatter weapon was detonated, sending a shockwave from the planet to the sun. This caused it to expand and condense, preparing to become supernova. Finally realizing their error, the world immediately went into panic, and only a few were able to get off-planet using a new experimental warp drive that allowed them to reach the speed of light. The few people who managed to get passage off Earth by bribery or position managed to send themselves hurtling deep into unknown space as the sun became a supernova, obliterating the entire solar system."
